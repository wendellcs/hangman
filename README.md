#    Hangman Game

## What is the objective?

* Your goal is to reach level 10.

## What is the category of words?

* At the moment, the words are basically food names (Fruits and Vegetables).

## How to play?

1. You can guess one letter at a time.
2. If a guessed letter is in the word, the letter will fill the corresponding blanks spaces.
3. If a guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman will be drawn. You lose after 7 wrong guesses.
4. You can continue guessing until you either correctly guess the word or the hangman isfully drawn.

## Good Luck! I hope you enjoy it :D
